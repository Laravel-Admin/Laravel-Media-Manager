# Laravel-Media-Manager
This package has 3 main goals:
* Provide an Eloquent model around your applications storage
* Create image styles for images and store or cache these
* Provide a Vue component to show and browse for media

> Note: This package is still under development. Using it on productions environments is on your own risk. Collaborations and tips are always welcome
